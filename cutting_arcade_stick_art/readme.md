# Cutting Custom Arcade Stick Art

When I first started working on [the EXPress](/readme.md), I had lots of worries about parts that would be difficult. Little did I know that one of the most difficult parts of this project would be something that never even occured to me to worry about: cutting circles. 

With traditional arcade buttons, you have little lips that cover any rough cuts, but with Choc switches, you don't have that luxury. Your cuts will be on full display, so they need to look good. 

I tested several methods and finally landed on one that produced good results. Here, I'll share my findings and tips. Not to spoil the surprise too much, but I only really recommend methods 1 and 4. 

## Method 1: Freehand with a standard hobby knife

You will want a hobby knife for this project anyway, so this is the cheaper approach with what you already have on hand. The results won't be as pretty, but if you're patient, you can still get decent looking cuts, especially at a distance.

It's not perfect, but the manga panels here mask the messiness a bit, so the style of art you choose can also matter. Some tips on this method: 

### Go very, very slow
By the time I was done with this one, my hand was in a lot of pain. I was cutting so slowly and carefully that the knife was pressing into my hand for a long time. I suggest doing half and coming back after a break. It's exciting to cut the art, but coming at it fresh helps you get better results. 

When cutting the circles, think about lots and lots of small straight cuts that create the sort of illusion of a circle. From a distance, this can work. 

### Use a new blade
This almost doesn't need to be said, but you want your blade to be as sharp as possible for this. I broke a blade near the end of cutting this one. You might want 2-3 blades on hand just in case. 

### Cover the art as you cut
If you have sweaty hands like me, there is a big risk of getting finger oils on the art as you work. Using anything really (cardboard works well) between your hands and the art helps a lot. Try to minimize the amount of skin contact you make with the art â€” that goes for any of these methods. 

## Method 2: A special circle cutting tool

![Circle cutting tool](/cutting_arcade_stick_art/readme_assets/circle-cutter.jpeg)

When I first saw this tool, I thought it would be perfect. It has adjustable circle width, and you can also adjust the height to account for different paper thicknesses. In theory, this is very cool. 

In practice, it is not, at least not for this purpose. I think this tool could work just fine for thinner paper or for cutting out tape to mask pieces while you paint, but it was incredibly frustrating to use for me. 

The adjustable height would be a good feature if it stayed consistent, but my unit got loose after just one pass at trying to cut a circle. Even with dozens of practice cuts, I could not get consistent results. It was also even harder to use on the art itself because the ink made the paper more slippery, thus it was very prone to moving around. It's possible that a similar circle cutting tool with a different mechanism might work better, but I would definitely not recommend this one (at least for cutting art).

## Method 3: A rotating hobby knife

After I failed to get good results with the circle cutter, I thought, "Maybe my first approach was good, and I just need a different tool." So, I tried this:

![Rotating hobby knife](/cutting_arcade_stick_art/readme_assets/rotating-hobby-knife.jpeg)

It is similar to a normal hobby knife, but the tip can spin 360 degrees. The idea is you can drag your hand along paper and get smooth curves. Here are the results:

![Back](/cutting_arcade_stick_art/readme_assets/using-tools-result-back.jpeg)

This worked... okay. I got a couple of really good circles, but it was hard to stay consistent. The first tip I got with the knife broke immediately. Fine, I got some extra tips just in case. The second tip held up better, but I got the sense it was not meant to handle thick paper very well. 

The blade was sharp, but not really *that* sharp. I often felt like I was partially ripping the paper while I cut it, and I think the quality of the cuts shows that. I tried both freehand and using the acrylic plate as a guide on top of the art. I don't think either approach made a huge difference. Using the plate seems like it would help, but I got caught on the sides a lot. I think with a lot of patience and maybe a different paper thickness, this could give you good results, but it wasn't doing it for me.

## Method 4: A hole punch tool

Finally, we arrive at my real recommendation: a hole punch. But this is not the hole punch you may be used to. It looks like this:

![Hole Punch Tool](/cutting_arcade_stick_art/readme_assets/hole-punch.jpg)

This is the tool I used specifically: [NEIKO 02604A Hole Punch Set](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YYWYNJ4). You line it up and then take a hammer and bang the top of it to cut. The concept is very similar to a normal hole punch, but more flexible with different sizes and no restriction on the depth of the thing you're cutting. 

Here are the results:

![Gundam](/cutting_arcade_stick_art/readme_assets/gundam-art-cut.jpeg)

Much, much better than anything up to this point. They're not quite perfect (I could have centered some of the holes a bit better, for example), but they look nice even from a close viewing distance, and you have to really inspect the controller to notice the issues. 

Here are some tips on using this tool:

### Use something relatively hard behind what you're cutting
The first time I tried this tool, I used it against cardboard. I think that might have worked eventually, but it absorbed a lot of the force. Instead, try some wood or something along those lines. 

![Preparing to hammer](/cutting_arcade_stick_art/readme_assets/prepare-cut-buttons.jpeg)

With a really solid strike or two, you can get a nice, clean circle. 

![Button cut out](/cutting_arcade_stick_art/readme_assets/one-button-cut.jpeg)

I used the underside of a lid to a box that I store my soldering supplied in, but a piece of scrap wood is better. This will make some marks in the wood.

Seriously, especially if you also use this tool to cut the smaller holes, it will be noticeable.

### Make sure the punch is entirely in contact with the paper

This was the thing I struggled with the most using this tool. You have to make sure the tool is flat against the artwork and you strike it nice and vertically. 

![Aligning the cutter](/cutting_arcade_stick_art/readme_assets/lining-up-cutter.jpeg)

I experimented with shifting the pressure around from one side to the other, but I got the best results from a solid vertical hit. I usually hammered each hole twice. Once I got used to it, most of them popped out perfectly. A few were nearly fully cut, which is easy to fix by hand. 

### You can use a hobby knife to fix incomplete cuts
Speaking of fixing cuts, if the punch didn't quite make a full circle, you have a judgement call to make: try the punch again or use a hobby knife. 
 
![Button about three-quarters cut](/cutting_arcade_stick_art/readme_assets/button-not-quite-cut.jpeg)

If you have a case like the above where the hole is two-thirds to three-quarters cut (or less), I'd try the hole punch again. The risk to this is if you're not aligned with your last hole, it can end up looking weird or creating small slivers of paper along the edge of holes to trim off.

You may also run into holes with a little bit of excess paper or that are nearly fully cut. In this case, I preferred to use a hobby knife to finish the job. You can use very light pressure, which keeps the knife controllable. If a button is almost cut but not quite, I like to finish the cut from the back of the art.
